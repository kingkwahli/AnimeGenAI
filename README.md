# AnimeGen AI Art Generator
### An (as ths name says) AI Anime art generator based on the [Anything-3.1 model](https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/anything-v3-1). </br>
**Has a custom-designed UI based on UserAgent strings that gives a platform-adaptive experience.** </br>
*(Basically, the website changes to the design of your device.)* </br>
Feel free to change whatever you want in a fork or push issues to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/kingkwahli/AnimeGenAI/issues) </br>
Note that this model is completely unrestricted and will generate anything you tell it to. </br>
Dark mode coming soon!! </br>
